# ServoPoint2


 DIY project of simple **[DCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control) Accessory decoder** for 2 servos and 2 relays.

This project is based on [ServoPoint2 by Paco CaÅ„ada](http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/home_en.htm)

* Platform:  Microchip PIC12F675 and PIC12F629
* Software Tools: MPLAB X IDE (mpasmx)

### Major improvements:

* Long pressing SWICH for about 2.5s (depends on CV545) enters programming mode.  Both servos move to central positions, outputs are set on.
* Direct CV programming and address change is only possibile in programing mode.
* Capturing new address or short pressing SWITCH exits programming mode.
